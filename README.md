# Sodbox

Sodbox, the Simple Object Database for XML, is a fork of the Perst database. Actually, it's not a real "fork", but just a 
place to experiment with some ideas. If you are interested in a Java object-oriented database, I'd recommend you check out 
Perst instead of Sodbox.

### Perst

Perst was originally written by [Konstantin Knizhnik](https://github.com/knizhnik). [McObject](http://www.mcobject.com/) 
continues development on [Perst](http://www.mcobject.com/perst) today and, like Knizhnik, releases it under a GPL license.
